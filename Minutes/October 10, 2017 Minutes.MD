## Stakeholder Meeting
### 8:51am - 9:30am

* Brad wants us to make a Gantt chart
  * Gantt chart is basically like backward planning (what we need to do to get to goal)
    * Include key deliverable times and when we need to meet
* Brad wants to be added on CI491 Blackboard so that he can use Blackboard Ultra/Collab with us (use whiteboards, etc.)
  * We can put files on Blackboard specifically named something like "file brad needs to review" or "stahkeholder needs to review"
* Only address Brad as Brad or Dr. Sodowick
* Brad's availability & contact:
  * M: teaches at another uni from 1-3
  * T,R: teaches from 10-12 on campus
  * W: teaches at another uni from 2-3
  * F: not on campus at all but can use teleconferencing
  * Contact info (check Slack)
    * Brad will only be contacting one person if he is running late
    * Feel free to text
* Project idea discussion
  * Initial thoughts from our end
    * Educational tool targeted at young adults our age
    * Use virtual money & archive data
    * Use virtual money to invest in X,Y,Z stocks --> will give you a graph, a simulated version of how that would play out
      * News clips from those times (curated from websites) will appear, associated with points in times for those stocks
      * Will help relate how the real world affects markets (we can look up existing material about how why markets have acted like they have in the past x years)
    * A lot of the tools in the software would be tools you can use to analyze your portfolios
  * Brad's thoughts
    * Target high school students & students newly entering uni because we are at a place where we now have more knowledge than they do, so project design doesn't have to be as complex
    * Having something targeted to people like "us" is very arbitrary, e.g. does "us" mean students in business, or engineering, or the arts? Each of "us" have varying degrees of financial knowledge
    * We wouldn't want to target people like Brad because the model would become super complicated/sophisticated
    * Less is more
    * The real question we should ask is: what would you have liked to learn about finance/whatever your topic is that would be helpful to you once you actually have money?
    * Brad is really into our project. For him, part of this is learning and part of this is grading. Because he is part of our project, he wants us to get an A and win senior design
    * By picking a younger demographic, there are things you can do to make the project rock:
      * Go to local high schools and ask: what should your students understand about the stock market and investing? Not saying they have money now, but think about what would be good for them to know
        * Also ask: what would you like to have had your children learn in high school about finance?
        * Brad's most successful Wharton teams were those who simplified things. Just because you ask doesn't mean you have to do
      * Understanding debt & investing might be good for those leaving high school and entering uni
      * Go out and ask people what they want --> look for an unmet need, and fill the gap
    * Saving money is the same as gaining money
      * Could invest in stocks, OR use that money to pay for an iPhone now for your own benefit and save money in the long run. What should you do?
      * E.g. you have two credit cards w/ 15% interest rate. Based on your investments, stock market will make 12% return. You have credit card debt of 15%. What is the best maximization of your return? It would be to pay off your credit card. But people don't think that way necessarily. Financing also has to do with decision making.
      * We have to understand how to make decisions and the tradeoffs of how we will make those decisions in terms of life
    * Make an app that teaches finance rather than investing specifically
      * A simple function: include links to videos/readings from Investopedia, S&P/NASDAQ intro learning materials
      * Check out Investing for Dummies & other similar resources
        * Our model is basically investing for dummies
        * Do the groundwork and understand what's been done. Some of the best ideas are existing ones, just executed better
        * Cramer (sp?) just did a segment on 5 things every college student needs to know about investing (e.g. 401k matching). We should include these things
    * Make sure we focus on our target demographic, whatever it may be (need to figure out exactly who we are targeting)
      * Public schools that are top rated? Intercity schools? etc.
      * Intercity might be difficult because student population is just so diverse
      * Intercity STEM schools might be okay
* Conclusions
  * We prefer to focus the app on investment and have teaching about finance things be like references (e.g. these are prereq knowledge things)
  * Our idea is NOT how to pick the best stocks
    * It's to understand where to place your money to have it grow
  * Once we contact our schools, we could see if they would want to potentially use our product in their classes at its completion or for testing
  * We will meet Tuesdays at 9am
* **Action items for next week**
  * Make basic project plan
  * Create Gantt chart
  * Add Brad to CI491 Blackboard course
  * Send Brad meeting invites on Google (every week on Tuesdays at 9am for now?)
  * Clarify/refine our ideas
  * Begin to talk to schools & gather requirements
