## Stakeholder Meeting
### 8:51am - 9:30am

* Brad wants us to make a Gantt chart
  * Gantt chart is basically like backward planning (what we need to do to get to goal)
    * Include key deliverable times and when we need to meet
* Brad wants to be added on CI491 Blackboard so that he can use Blackboard Ultra/Collab with us (use whiteboards, etc.)
  * We can put files on Blackboard specifically named something like "file brad needs to review" or "stahkeholder needs to review"
* Only address Brad as Brad or Dr. Sodowick
* Brad's availability & contact:
  * M: teaches at another uni from 1-3
  * T,R: teaches from 10-12 on campus
  * W: teaches at another uni from 2-3
  * F: not on campus at all but can use teleconferencing
  * Contact info (check Slack)
    * Brad will only be contacting one person if he is running late
    * Feel free to text
* Project idea discussion
  * Initial thoughts from our end
    * Educational tool targeted at young adults our age
    * Use virtual money & archive data
    * Use virtual money to invest in X,Y,Z stocks --> will give you a graph, a simulated version of how that would play out
      * News clips from those times (curated from websites) will appear, associated with points in times for those stocks
      * Will help relate how the real world affects markets (we can look up existing material about how why markets have acted like they have in the past x years)
    * A lot of the tools in the software would be tools you can use to analyze your portfolios
  * Brad's thoughts
    * Target high school students & students newly entering uni because we are at a place where we now have more knowledge than they do, so project design doesn't have to be as complex
    * Having something targeted to people like "us" is very arbitrary, e.g. does "us" mean students in business, or engineering, or the arts? Each of "us" have varying degrees of financial knowledge
    * We wouldn't want to target people like Brad because the model would become super complicated/sophisticated
    * Less is more
    * The real question we should ask is: what would you have liked to learn about finance/whatever your topic is that would be helpful to you once you actually have money?
    * Brad is really into our project. For him, part of this is learning and part of this is grading. Because he is part of our project, he wants us to get an A and win senior design
    * By picking a younger demographic, there are things you can do to make the project rock:
      * Go to local high schools and ask: what should your students understand about the stock market and investing? Not saying they have money now, but think about what would be good for them to know
        * Also ask: what would you like to have had your children learn in high school about finance?
        * Brad's most successful Wharton teams were those who simplified things. Just because you ask doesn't mean you have to do
      * Understanding debt & investing might be good for those leaving high school and entering uni
      * Go out and ask people what they want --> look for an unmet need, and fill the gap
    * Saving money is the same as gaining money
      * Could invest in stocks, OR use that money to pay for an iPhone now for your own benefit and save money in the long run. What should you do?
      * E.g. you have two credit cards w/ 15% interest rate. Based on your investments, stock market will make 12% return. You have credit card debt of 15%. What is the best maximization of your return? It would be to pay off your credit card. But people don't think that way necessarily. Financing also has to do with decision making.
      * We have to understand how to make decisions and the tradeoffs of how we will make those decisions in terms of life
    * Make an app that teaches finance rather than investing specifically
      * A simple function: include links to videos/readings from Investopedia, S&P/NASDAQ intro learning materials
      * Check out Investing for Dummies & other similar resources
        * Our model is basically investing for dummies
        * Do the groundwork and understand what's been done. Some of the best ideas are existing ones, just executed better
        * Cramer (sp?) just did a segment on 5 things every college student needs to know about investing (e.g. 401k matching). We should include these things
    * Make sure we focus on our target demographic, whatever it may be (need to figure out exactly who we are targeting)
      * Public schools that are top rated? Intercity schools? etc.
      * Intercity might be difficult because student population is just so diverse
      * Intercity STEM schools might be okay
* Conclusions
  * We prefer to focus the app on investment and have teaching about finance things be like references (e.g. these are prereq knowledge things)
  * Our idea is NOT how to pick the best stocks
    * It's to understand where to place your money to have it grow
  * Once we contact our schools, we could see if they would want to potentially use our product in their classes at its completion or for testing
  * We will meet Tuesdays at 9am
* **Action items for next week**
  * Make basic project plan
  * Create Gantt chart
  * Add Brad to CI491 Blackboard course
  * Send Brad meeting invites on Google (every week on Tuesdays at 9am for now?)
  * Clarify/refine our ideas
  * Begin to talk to schools & gather requirements

## Review meeting
### 6:00pm - 6:30pm

* Notes
  * It would be irresponsible for Vokolos to give us advice, really, since he doesn't know much about finance
  * What he can tell us is that if we come to him with a project, he will tell us what we should come up with each term in order to have a finished product at the end
  * Vokolos needs to understand what the stakeholder is asking us to do
  * There are a lot of existing tools. Vokolos thinks that our stakeholder may be able to provide guidance as to how to enrich the idea
  * The educational component is the thing that will differentiate our product from existing tools is what it seems like our stakeholder (and we) are saying
    * This means that we may not have to target high school students specifically, but really just anyone who may not have a lot of financial knowledge
  * First we need to figure out what the problem we are trying to solve is
    * Vokolos agrees that Investment for Dummies is a good place to start and it's fine for us to talk to our high schools
    * He thinks all of these suggestions are fine and just wants us to know what we need to do
  * Part of the preliminary project plan is to come with questions
    * For now, include whatever we think should go on it. Then Vokolos will look at it and tell us if each thing makes sense or not
  * It sounds to Vokolos that we have a scope but not an idea
  * Project Phase Leads slide
    * We can leave it like this OR have someone who is responsible for system architecture, and one for detailed system design (break up system/software design)
    * If we leave it, make sure the double leads coordinate
  * Issues slide
    * Conflicting schedules --> resolved
    * Lack of domain knowledge --> still unresolved
      * To resolve: we have to do research (read up on basics)
      * Put a deadline in the plan for acquirement of basic knowledge
    * Broad scope --> still unresolved
  * Action Items slide
    * Mike Galloway --> send email, copy Vokolos, say that we work on CI 491 section 5 and we want our stakeholder to be added on blackboard
      * As long as Vokolos is CCed on it, Mike should have no problem adding Brad
    * Not typical to meet with stakeholder weekly, but typical to meet with him a lot early on until you have your project defined
    * Gantt chart is basically part of the project plan (since it will come from the project plan anyway)
  * Questions slide
    * If you really want a decent project plan, you need dates on it. Thus, preliminary project plan should have dates
      * Even after plan is baselined, dates will always change
      * Do the best that you can so that you at least have something to work off of --> dates ALWAYS change
  * Vokolos thinks we may have a project, but we really don't have a project yet
    * There is potential, but nothing concrete
    * Need to get our hands around the capabilities of our product so that we can start to develop
    * There is work to be done to get our hands around it
    * Need to get something that describes the features of the system we will have and something that will be useful to our target customers
    * At this point, we have something to work with, but much remains to be done before we have a definitive project
* **Action items**
  * Come up with a project/team name
  * Email Professor Vokolos a copy of our PowerPoint
    * Bring a printed copy of our slidedeck for subsequent meetings so he can take notes
  * Think about whether to split system/software design leads into two separate sys arch and detailed software design leads
